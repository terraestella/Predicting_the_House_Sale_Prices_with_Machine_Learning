This project will try to predict the house sale prices using the dataset of marketed houses in Ames, Iowa. The dataset consist of 82 features for each house sold, including the price it was sold for.
The steps to be taken in order to predict the sale price of a new house are as follows:

1. Analyzing data and understanding the features describing the houses
2. Data processing and preparing for deeper analysis
3. Choosing the features to be used in predictive modelling
4. Building the model and evaluating results
5. Answering which properties of a house most affect the final sale price

**Dataset:**
- Sold houses in Ames, Iowa - 2930 rows, 82 columns
- Each row in the dataset describes the properties (the columns) of a single house, as well as the amount it was sold for
